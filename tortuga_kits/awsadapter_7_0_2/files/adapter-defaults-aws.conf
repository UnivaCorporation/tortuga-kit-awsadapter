# This is the resource adapter configuration file. Options in this
# file tell Tortuga how you want nodes managed in Amazon EC2, Eucalyptus, or
# other AWS-compatible cloud service.

# Replicate the '[resource-adapter]' section for each hardware profile with the
# section name being the case-sensitive hardware profile name. This allows for
# concurrent support for Amazon EC2 and Eucalyptus or other AWS-compatible
# services.

[resource-adapter]

# Eucalyptus only! Leave undefined on Amazon EC2
#
# This value must be set to the hostname or IP address of your
# Eucalyptus Node Controller or Cloud Controller. This is the machine
# which provides access to the Eucalyptus API.

# These values must be provided and are not optional:
#
#  awsAccessKey - This is your Amazon EC2 or Eucalyptus Web Service access key
#  awsSecretKey - This is your Amazon EC2 or Eucalyptus Web Service secret key

#awsAccessKey =

# This item specifies the SSH keypair name (created by you in your EC2
# account) used for nodes. If you do not specify it, you will only be
# able to login to compute nodes from your head node.

#keypair =

# You must provide an AMI/EMI ID to create nodes.

#ami =

# You must choose an instance type for your nodes. Pricing on instances is
# dependent upon Amazon's current pricing as well as any instance reservations
# your account may have access to, so be sure to verify the cost of an instance
# type before using it.
#
# Consult https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ for pricing info.

# Note: some instance types have restrictions, especially when using 'hvm'
# AMIs

# These options permit you to override the default kernel (AKI/EKI) and ramdisk
# image (ARI/ERI) for your nodes if desired. Normally, you should avoid doing
# so as the kernel modules must match what is present in the AMI for a
# successful boot. Changing these options without verifying compatibility can
# result in EC2 nodes which do not complete booting.
#
# Do not enable these options if you are not certain they are compatible.
#aki =
#ari =

# (optional) Sets the 'region' where your nodes will be created. Must be
# set to # "Eucalyptus" if using Eucalyptus
#
#region =

# (recommended) The names of the security groups with which to associate
# instances. If undefined or left blank, the 'default' security group will
# be used. Multiple security groups can be specified separated by commas.

# Note: instance type must have an ephemeral disk associated with it,
# otherwise an error will be displayed.
